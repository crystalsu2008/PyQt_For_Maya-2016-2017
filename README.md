# PyQt_To_Maya-2016-2017
&emsp; This is my practices for learning Mike Cole's tutorial, the ["Advanced PyQt for Maya"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/advanced-pyqt-maya-2122/table-of-contentsThe). The tutorial used the Maya 2015 and ```PyQt4```. But I worked under the Maya 2016 and ```PySide```, I even want to use the Maya 2017. But the Maya 2017 came with a big change, PySide and PyQt4 no longer works with Maya. Maya now uses ```Qt5``` and ```PySide2```. So in this practices, I'm going to try to convert original ```PyQt4``` code to the ```PySide``` and ```PySide2``` code.

&emsp; Here is a very useful guide to help convert Maya PySide script to PySide2 script, [Dealing with Maya 2017 and PySide2](https://fredrikaverpil.github.io/2016/07/25/dealing-with-maya-2017-and-pyside2/). It's form Fredrik's Blog, thank a lot.
